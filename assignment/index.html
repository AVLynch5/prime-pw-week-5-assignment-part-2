      <p>Questions for this week:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If a header with class "XYZ" is created containing two elements, can I apply styling specifically to one element in the CSS stylesheet? IE using element1.XYZ {} (ex. h1.toptext {}) or something?</li>
        <li>I tried creating a div of class "img" within the body element and put the header/main elements into the div. However, when the background-image style was applied to .img, the background image only appeared in the space between the header and main elements instead of the whole page. The background displays fine when the background-image style is applied directly to the body element. Why is this?</li>
